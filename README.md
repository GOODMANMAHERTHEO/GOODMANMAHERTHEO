 Data Recovery Script

This script recovers data from multiple email accounts and a Google Sheets document. It logs into each email account, fetches all emails, and prints out the subjects. It also fetches data from a specified Google Sheets document.

## Prerequisites

1. **API Access**:
   - Obtain API keys and necessary permissions from the respective services.
2. **Libraries**:
   - Use libraries such as `google-api-python-client` for Google services.
   - Use IMAP/SMTP libraries for email access.

## Explanation

### Email Recovery
- The script logs into each email account using IMAP and fetches all emails from the inbox.
- It prints out the subjects of the emails for simplicity, but you can extend this to save emails or perform other actions.

### Google Sheets Recovery
- The script uses Google Sheets API to fetch data from a specified Google Sheets document.
- It uses a service account for authentication. Make sure you have the `service_account.json` file with the necessary permissions.

## Steps to Run the Script

1. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Set up your service account** and download the `service_account.json` file from the Google Cloud Console.

3. **Replace placeholder values** like email passwords and Google Sheets ID with actual values in the `data_recovery.py` script.

4. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python data_recovery.py
   ```

## Important Note
- **Security**: Storing passwords directly in the script is not secure. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the email accounts and Google Sheets.
- **API Limits**: Be aware of any API rate limits and handle them appropriately in production code.- 👋 Hi, I’m @GOODMANMAHERTHEO
