To use the websocket-treasury-settlement-contract in Python, you'll need to interact with the web3.py library, which allows you to interact with Ethereum and other Web3-compatible networks. Below is an explanation of how to use the contract and an example.

Explanation:
- First, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The primary library for interacting with smart contracts is web3.py.
- You must have an Ethereum wallet to interact with the contract. This wallet will contain the private key needed to make transactions.
- Obtain the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) and address. The ABI is a JSON-like structure that describes the contract's methods and their parameters.
- Use `web3.py` to connect to an Ethereum node.
- Create a contract object with the ABI and contract address.
- Load your wallet and sign transactions.
- Interact with the contract by calling its functions.

Example (`web3.py` code):

python
# Install web3.py and other necessary libraries if not already installed
# pip install web3
# pip install web3[eth]

import web3
from web3 import Web3
from web3.contract import Contract
from web3.middleware import geth_poa_middleware
import json

# Set your private key and the address of the account that will interact with the contract
private_key = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
account_address = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'

# Set the Web3 provider. Replace 'YOUR_INFURA_ENDPOINT' with your Infura endpoint or local node URL
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('YOUR_INFURA_ENDPOINT'))

# Load the contract ABI and address
# Replace 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI.json' and 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' with the actual files and values
with open('YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI.json', 'r') as file:
    contract_abi = json.load(file)

contract_address = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'

# Connect to the Ethereum network and create a Web3 contract instance
w3 = Web3(Web3.WebsocketProvider('YOUR_INFURA_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT'))
w3.middleware_onion.inject(geth_poa_middleware, layer=0)

# Create a contract instance
contract = Contract(
    address=contract_address,
    abi=contract_abi,
)

# Unlock the account with the private key
w3.eth.account.unlock(account_address, private_key)

# Function to purchase tokens
def purchase_tokens(amount):
    # Get the purchase function from the contract
    purchase_function = contract.functions['purchaseTokens']
    
    # Call the purchase function with the desired amount
    # Make sure to convert the amount to the correct token unit (e.g., wei)
    transaction = purchase_function(amount)
    
    # Sign the transaction with the account's private key
    signed_txn = w3.eth.account.sign_transaction(
        transaction,
        private_key=private_key,
    )
    
    # Send the signed transaction to the network
    transaction_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(
        signed_txn.rawTransaction,
    )
    
    return transaction_hash

# Example usage
# Replace '100' with the actual number of tokens you want to purchase and '0x...' with the recipients' addresses
# Also, ensure you have sufficient ETH in the account for gas fees
amount_to_purchase = 100
recipient_address = '0x...'

tx_hash = purchase_tokens(amount_to_purchase)
print(f"Tokens purchased successfully with transaction hash: {tx_hash}")


In this example, I've used Web3.WebsocketProvider to connect to an Ethereum network using a WebSocket connection and `geth_poa_middleware` for a faster interaction with a proof-of-authority (POA) network like Rinkeby. The purchase_tokens function

 recovers data from multiple email accounts and a Google Sheets document. It logs into each email account, fetches all emails, and prints out the subjects. It also fetches data from a specified Google Sheets document.

## Prerequisites

1. **API Access**:
   - Obtain API keys and necessary permissions from the respective services.
2. **Libraries**:
   - Use libraries such as `google-api-python-client` for Google services.
   - Use IMAP/SMTP libraries for email access.

## Explanation

### Email Recovery
- The script logs into each email account using IMAP and fetches all emails from the inbox.
- It prints out the subjects of the emails for simplicity, but you can extend this to save emails or perform other actions.

### Google Sheets Recovery
- The script uses Google Sheets API to fetch data from a specified Google Sheets document.
- It uses a service account for authentication. Make sure you have the `service_account.json` file with the necessary permissions.

## Steps to Run the Script

1. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Set up your service account** and download the `service_account.json` file from the Google Cloud Console.

3. **Replace placeholder values** like email passwords and Google Sheets ID with actual values in the `data_recovery.py` script.

4. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python data_recovery.py
   ```

## Important Note
- **Security**: Storing passwords directly in the script is not secure. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the email accounts and Google Sheets.
- **API Limits**: Be aware of any API rate limits and handle them appropriately in production code.- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @GOODMANMAHERTHEO
